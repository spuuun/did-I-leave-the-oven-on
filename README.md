Means of Production is a distributed tool sharing library
Users are able to register their own tools for borrowing and borrow tools from their neighbors

The application allows users to track and manage the status of their loans, and return tools to their owners.

In the future, I would like to integrate optional location services that would allow users to see nearby tools in a map view.

This project was inspired by brick and mortar tool libraries - especially The Station North Tool Library located in Baltimore.

The dream is for this application to empower tinkerers and enthusiasts to explore new areas of interest that may otherwise be unavailable because of the high startup cost of purchasing specialized tools - and help the DIY handyperson to affordably build and take care of their homes and everything in them.
